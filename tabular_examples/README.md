# Tabular Reinforcement Learning Examples

All algorithms presented in the Jupyter Notebooks are based on the book by [Sutton and Barto](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html). The algorithms serve as a supplement to the exercise and lecture. We split the algorithms into two groups: Tabular reinforcement learning and dynamic programming algorithms. We invite students to try using and modifying the algorithms to deepen the understanding of the course material.
