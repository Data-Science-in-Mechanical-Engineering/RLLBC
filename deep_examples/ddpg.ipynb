    "### Agent Model Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Agent` class consists of two different architectures of neural networks: a network for the actor (`ActorNetwork`) and a network for the Q-values (`QNetwork`). The Q-network takes state and action as input and evaluates to a scalar value that approximates the expected return until the end of the episode. The actor network takes the state as input and evaluates to a continuous action vector. Note that the actor network evaluates to an action in $[-1,1]^n$ and subsequently transforms it to the actual action space of the environment. By doing it in this way, the network always outputs a valid action - inside the boundaries of the environment's action space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to [DQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) the `Agent` class uses target networks to stabilize the learning process. In particular, it holds a target network for the actor as well as a target Q-network. So, in total, it makes use of 4 different networks and provides methods to query each of them, i.e. `get_q_value`, `get_target_q_value`, `get_action`, and `get_target_action`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the target networks will not be subject to the optimizer, meaning they will not be modified through gradient steps. Instead, the `Agent` class provides the function `track_networks` to make the parameters of the target networks slowly track the parameters of the learned networks by the linear combination $\\theta^t \\leftarrow \\tau\\theta + (1-\\tau)\\theta^t$ with $\\tau \\ll 1$."
